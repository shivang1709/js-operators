//Check the conditons
//You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:

//1. if both are divisible by 10 console true.
//2. if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
//3. if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
//Use operator to do this.
//Note: You have to complete Check function. No need to take any input.
